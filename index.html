      <p class="history-text">
        <span>The first World Wide Web</span> was invented in 1989 and introduced to
        the world on August 6, 1991 at the European Organization for Nuclear
        Research (CERN). It was created by the British computer scientist
        <span>Tim Berners-Lee</span> on his Next computer designed by Steve Jobs.
        The web was originally developed for universities and institutes in all
        the world as a solution for a demand for automated information-sharing
        between scientists.
        In 1992 there were only 10 websites. In 1993, CERN put the WWW software
        in the public domain and later on made a release available with an open
        license. By 1996 there were already 2 million websites.
